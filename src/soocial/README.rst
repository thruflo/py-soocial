Look at how to deal with:

/contacts/ID/phone_numbers.xml
/contacts/ID/phone_numbers/ID.xml
/contacts/ID/email_addresses.xml
/contacts/ID/email_addresses/ID.xml
/contacts/ID/organisations.xml
/contacts/ID/organisations/ID.xml
/contacts/ID/urls.xml
/contacts/ID/urls/ID.xml
/contacts/ID/street_addresses.xml
/contacts/ID/street_addresses/ID.xml
/user.xml
/users.xml
/connections/phones.xml


i.e.: create a contact object which contains phone no.'s, urls etc.

plus how to handle user / users / connections/phones?
